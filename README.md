# ufetch

ufetch is a command-line tool that displays basic system information in a minimal and stylized format. It provides details such as the operating system name, CPU, RAM, uptime, and shell name.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csq/ufetch/master/ufetch
chmod +x ufetch
sudo mv ufetch /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage
